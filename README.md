# Full Stack AI Apps

This is a full-stack template project for Memex to create  applications with AI! Check-out the pills above for some end-to-end examples.

This template is based on a [template from Ansh & Riley](https://github.com/ansh/template-2). Check out more of their work at https://x.com/rileybrown_ai

## Overview
This template comes preloaded with 4 AI Apps in the pills above. (Note: The pills are only accessible from the template page. If you've cloned it to your local environment, you can access them under the `path` directory under the `</> Code` tab):
- AI Chat app
- Image generator app
- Simple social network
- Voice note app

When prompted, you can save and manage your LLM providers API Keys by using [Memex Secrets](https://docs.memex.tech/using-memex/secrets)

## Quick start

Just click in one of the Pills in the template page to access the app prompts. Run it and see your app come to life!

You can use these prompts as inspiration for your next AI app!

## Technology Stack
- React with Next.js 14 App Router
- TailwindCSS
- Firebase Auth, Storage, and Database
- Multiple AI endpoints including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Replicate using Vercel's AI SDK

## Development

If available, see Rules for AI (rendered from `.memex/rules.md`) for detailed development guidelines Memex will follow, including:
- Complete setup instructions
- Model-specific parameters
- Error handling
- Potential improvements
- Development workflow

You can ask Memex to update rules.md to reflect your project needs as you expand it, or set it as part of your Custom Instructions so that it does it automatically after important steps.
